# AI4S Teen Cup Final
My repo for AI4S Teen Cup Final.

[Contest Page](https://bohrium.dp.tech/competitions/4225422946?tab=introduce)

**Files under folders**:
- `baseline.ipynb` The baseline file provided to contestants.
- `solution.py` My solution, in python.
- `submission.ipynb` My submission file, in jupiter notebook, since they only accept `.ipynb`, which sucks.
- `physics/model0.5645.pth` The model I trained.
- `physics/train.ipynb` The notebook used to train the model, and is actually `solution.py` for the physics problem.
- Other files are probably provided by the host of the contest.

 My Score:

| Score                 | Math     | Biology  | Physics  | Chemistry | Total    |
| --------------------- |----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| A Score               | 1.0000/1 | 0.5151/1 | 0.5689/1 | 1.0000/1  | 3.0840/4 |
| B Score (final score) | 1.0000/1 | 0.4545/1 | 0.5411/1 | 1.0000/1  | 2.9956/4 |

A total score of 3.00 is required to get a gold award in the contest. However, I still got the gold award because they rounded the total score to 2 digits, which made my total score 3.00. :)
